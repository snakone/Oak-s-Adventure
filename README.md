## Assets/Sprites

All the code is *open source*, you can check, take advice, copy/paste it to your own project.
In other terms, graphical content is hidden by default. This includes all Assets and Sprites.
You still can download the original files from [Sprite Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/).
I spend a lot of time editing the original files, that's why the graphical content is not available for everyone.
Let's say at least i want to have exclusive content for the game, knowing it's 100% inspired in Pokémon.
